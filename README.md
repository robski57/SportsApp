# SportsApp
Sports app is a merch applacation that allows the user to select a few items while it keeps track of what items are added and the price of the them.

First I started off with small inventory of items and prices and place them in a dictionay and I assign their price with them.

Next, I created  two var and they both we assigned empty brackets basket and total to hold any appended information.
